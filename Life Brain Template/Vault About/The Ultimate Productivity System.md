> Productivity is using our time **INTENTIONALLY** and **EFFECTIVELY**.

The purpose of a productivity system is simple, it needs to keep your life in order. It needs to simplify the process of managing your time. A productivity system allows you to do meaningful things without wasting time. It allows us to not rely on our brain to do things it wasn't made to do.

> “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” - David Allen

Our brain is made to do Type I things—Creativity, enjoyment, relaxation, and connecting thoughts, information, and with other people. Type II things can be done with our brain but can ben be implemented in a productivity system—Things such as tasks, calendars, emails, etc. And lastly Type III things are better off implemented in a productivity system as they are not always related, necessary, and only needs to be remembered—Things to remember such as shopping lists, someday lists, phone numbers, birthdays, etc.

Your vault is organized using the P.A.R.A Method and each note is organized using the C.O.D.E Method.

# P.A.R.A Method

I use this method because I found this is the best way to categorize my notes into actionable chunks of information. The P.A.R.A Method stands for:
- **Projects:** Short-term efforts
- **Areas:** Long-term roles and responsibilities
- **Resources:** Future interests and useful topics 
- **Archives:** Inactive items from the other categories

# C.O.D.E Method

I use this method to process information and be neatly stored inside a note. The C.O.D.E Method stands for:

- **Capture:** Keep what resonates
- **Organize:** Save for actionability
- **Distill:** Find the essence 
- **Express:** Show your work

# VUCA Method

This method is to understand the unpredictability of life.

- **Volatility** Rate of change
- **Uncertainty** Unclear about the present.
- **Complexity** Multiple key decision factors.
- **Ambiguity** Lack of clarity about meaning of an event

# What I Added

- **Shitpile:** Anything fleeting and random.
